# Tic Tac Toe 
Tic Tac Toe in Node.js using Socket.io made for TIwPR labs purposes.
Two players in each room, you can set up as many rooms as you want.
Board is drawn on canvas and the state of game is recalling every time user refresh his browser.
I used session storage and tight communication with server for this purpose.
